1. Naming convention for all filenames, paths and folders
- The naming conventions for all filenames should be lowercase, no spaces and dashes are fine. Folder naming convention should be similar to filenames. For paths, the folders, assets and files should be inside the root folder so they can be easily linked inside any .html files
    `index.html`
    2. Best practices for commit messages
    - Commit messages should be descriptive and not use the same terminology too often. Each commit should have a distinct name and commit messages should be a 5 words to a sentence long. Commit messages should also not be in all caps.
    3. What is HTML?
    - HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Language" and is the code language used to create the contents of websites.
    4. Proper Syntax for HTML Elements
    - HTML elements are mainly comprised of block elements and inline elements, which are enclosed within opening and closing tags, such as
    <p>paragraph</p>. Certain elements such as <img> do not require a closing tag and instead are just a tag with the content specified inside.
    5. Explain or demonstrate commonly used HTML tags/elements:
    - Headings, created with <h1> through <h6>, create text at various set sizes, usually to mark different sections of the page.
    - Paragraphs are created with <p>, the tag designates text in a small body font to appear on the page.
    - Lists, created with <ul>, <ol> or <dl> create a row of text for each item in the list, which can be marked with dashes, dots, numbers, etc. 
    - Links are created with <a>, being clickable text that takes the user to another page, file, etc.
    - Images are placed with <img>, and are displayed on the page or within another element via a link.
     -
     - Quotes are marked with <q>, typically within another element.
     - Block quotes, created with <blockquote>, are their own text element on a page.
     - Citations are created with <cite>, and show the source of a quote.
     - <em> marks text as emphasized, making it bolder.
     - <strong> emphasizes text even more them <em>.
     - <b> marks a keyword.
     - <i> is used to mark another language, title or technical term.
