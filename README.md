1. Naming convention for all filenames, paths and folders
- The naming conventions for all filenames should be lowercase, no spaces and dashes are fine. Folder naming convention should be similar to filenames. For paths, the folders, assets and files should be inside the root folder so they can be easily linked inside any .html files
    `index.html`
    2. Best practices for commit messages
    - Commit messages should be descriptive and not use the same terminology too often. Each commit should have a distinct name and commit messages should be a 5 words to a sentence long. Commit messages should also not be in all caps.
    3. What is HTML?
    - HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Language" and is the code language used to create the contents of websites.
    4. Proper Syntax for HTML Elements
    - HTML elements are mainly comprised of block elements and inline elements, which are enclosed within opening and closing tags, such as
    <p>paragraph</p>. Certain elements such as <img> do not require a closing tag and instead are just a tag with the content specified inside.
    5. Explain or demonstrate commonly used HTML tags/elements:
    - Headings, created with <h1> through <h6>, create text at various set sizes, usually to mark different sections of the page.
    - Paragraphs are created with <p>, the tag designates text in a small body font to appear on the page.
    - Lists, created with <ul>, <ol> or <dl> create a row of text for each item in the list, which can be marked with dashes, dots, numbers, etc. 
    - Links are created with <a>, being clickable text that takes the user to another page, file, etc.
    - Images are placed with <img>, and are displayed on the page or within another element via a link.
     -
     - Quotes are marked with <q>, typically within another element.
     - Block quotes, created with <blockquote>, are their own text element on a page.
     - Citations are created with <cite>, and show the source of a quote.
     - <em> marks text as emphasized, making it bolder.
     - <strong> emphasizes text even more them <em>.
     - <b> marks a keyword.
     - <i> is used to mark another language, title or technical term.
     - <small> shrinks text, making it harder to read but also take up less space on the page.
     6. Explain block Elements and also explain the list of block elements and why they are used from below:
     - Block elements are elements that take up the entire row of the rows they occupy, and are as tall as their contents.
     - 
     -
     - body
     - Headers are marked with <header>, designating the section which appears at the top of the page.
     - The navigation element (<nav>) is a block element containing links to navigate to other pages of the website.
     - The main tag, <main>, designates the main contents of the page and tells the browser where it is.
     - The section tag, <section>, designates a section of the page's content allowing the browser to recognize it. It also allows for easy navigation to that section.
     - <article> marks on article on the page, allowing hte browser to recognize its location and for quick navigation to it if given an ID.
     - The <div> tag marks a division in the page, acting as a container for elements.
     - <aside> is an element used to contain content which is only somewhat relevant to the main content of the page.
     - <footer> is used to contain elements at the bottom of the page.
     - <span> is an inline container for content with no specific purpose.
     - <small> is used to designate smaller text for things like copyright tags, descriptions for images/videos, etc.
     7.Explain why accessibility is important and also explain the accessibility properties like:
     - Accessibility is important because being able to use the internet is a crucial part of modern day-to-day life. Not making websites with those with impairments and disabilities in mind would prevent many people from using it and be unfair.
     - Landmark roles are a set of roles that allow those with screen readers to jump from section to section of the page.
     - Aria labels are labels that can be read by screen readers for those with disabilities that prevent them from reading the contents of the page normally.
     - Image alternative texts are text specified for an image which is read by screen readers.
